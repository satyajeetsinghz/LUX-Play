                    <p>(A massive obsidian throne sits in the center of a dark infernal chamber. Flames flicker unnaturally, casting shadows across the walls. LUCIFER MORNINGSTAR sits on the throne, sipping whiskey from a crystal glass. His usual smirk is absent—he looks... tired.)</p>

                    <p>A sudden whisper echoes through the chamber.</p>

                    <p>WHISPER (V.O.)</p>
                    <p>"The balance is broken. He is awakening."</p>

                    <p>Lucifer straightens, narrowing his eyes. The flames dim. The air turns heavy.</p>

                    <p> LUCIFER (to himself, sighing)</p>
                    <em> "Oh, fantastic. Another cosmic disaster. And here I was, just getting comfortable."</em>

                    <p>Suddenly, the ground rumbles. The spirits in Hell scream as a shadowy rift cracks open in the air. Lucifer stands, his glass shattering in his hand.</p>

                    <p> LUCIFER (annoyed)</p>
                    <em> "Right. That’s new."</em>

                    <p>(RORY DECKER-MORNINGSTAR, Lucifer’s daughter, jolts awake. Her wings flicker uncontrollably. She clutches her head, breathing heavily.)</p>

                    <p>She glances at her nightstand—a sketchbook filled with disturbing drawings. One stands out: A cloaked figure with hollow, burning eyes.</p>

                    <p>Her phone buzzes. She grabs it and dials.</p>

                    <p>LUCIFER (V.O.)</p>
                    <em>“You’ve reached Lucifer Morningstar. If this is about selling your soul—”</em>

                    <p>RORY (cutting him off, frantic)</p>
                    <em>"Dad! Something’s wrong. I think someone’s trying to escape Hell."</em>

                    <p>(The city skyline looms. A portal opens in a deserted alley. LUCIFER steps through, adjusting his suit. The moment his feet touch Earth, the sky darkens unnaturally. A faint earthquake shakes the ground.)</p>

                    <p>From the shadows, a figure emerges—MAZIKEEN (MAZE), knives in hand.</p>

                    <p>MAZE (grinning)</p>

                    <p>(Before she can respond, a golden light flares—AMENADIEL appears. His expression is grim.)</p>
